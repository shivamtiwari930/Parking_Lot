## Parking Lot System Project

While parking a vehicle, the user has to specify their vehicle’s type (Car, Truck, or Motorcycle) 

and the vehicle’s plate number. This program accepts any valid string as a plate number. 

The program also checks for duplicate plate numbers and does not let the system add duplicate ones.

After successfully adding, the system shows the entry time for two seconds, then the system returns to the main menu.

If adding is unsuccessful, the system shows an error then returns to the main menu.

Here I have used the OOPS concept,

At any point, the user can view the information of any vehicle currently stored within the lot.

Selecting a valid row and space will return the vehicle’s type, plate number, and date/time of entry.

Similarly, when leaving the lot, the user has to specify the row and space of the vehicle they want to remove. 

If space selection is valid, the vehicle will be removed from the space. 

The program will calculate a user’s fare based on how many hours were spent in the lot.
